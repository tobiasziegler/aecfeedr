# Contributing to aecfeedr development

## Pull Requests

I'd encourage you to get in touch (contact details are in the `DESCRIPTION`) or open an issue in the GitHub repository for the package if you're interested in contributing to development. At this stage the package is in early development and will need a lot of features added as well as changes to the way it works, so help will be welcomed but I'm also still working out the best way to approach things.

To contribute a change to the package:

1. Fork and clone the repository, then create a new branch from the `develop` branch (not `master`) to commit your work into.
1. When working with the code for your changes, follow the [tidyverse style guide](http://style.tidyverse.org/), write [roxygen](https://github.com/klutometis/roxygen) documentation for new parameters and functions, and ensure that the package passes `R CMD Check` with no errors, warnings or notes. For more general advice on package development, check out [Hadley Wickham's *R Packages* book](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/).
1. Once you think your changes are complete, push them to your GitHub repository and create a pull request back to `tobiasziegler/aecfeedr` and explain what your changes do and why you've made them.
1. From there, be prepared for discussion and iteration when we look at integrating the pull request.
